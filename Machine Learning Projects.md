Develop a machine learning model to segment customers into different groups according to their behavior and preferences. Without a doubt, this helps in budgeting, marketing, and promotion. However, this calls for knowledge of clustering techniques and algorithms like k-means clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, agglomerative clustering, and BIRCH.

**5. Churn Prediction**

These machine learning projects use an [ML model](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-023-00721-8) to predict whether customers are likely to terminate their subscription with a company. One will learn classification and feature engineering as they’ll be using logistic regression, neural networks, and Random Forests.

**6. Spam Email Classification**

Tons of promotional emails spam our inboxes every day. Hence, a spam email classification machine learning project can be extremely beneficial. The most popular ML techniques for this project are decision tree, artificial immune, SVM, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and case-based techniques.

**7. Recommendation System**

The consumer industry is scaling massively, and people need personalized recommendations for products and services. One can therefore build an ML recommendation system that provides customized recommendations based on past behavior and preferences. Furthermore, this helps one learn about collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. This project can also easily be built in Python.

**8. Loan Default Prediction**

For this project, develop a model to predict which loan applicants will likely default. In fact, it will help to learn about the classification and imbalanced data in machine learning. Consequently, one can use multiple machine learning algorithms for this project, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. However, research suggests that Random Forest and XGBoost are the two best ML algorithms for this purpose.

One can build an advanced speech recognition model using machine learning and AI. Overall, it requires using signal processing and ML techniques to extract features from audio data and build models that can accurately recognize speech. Moreover, the language models that can be used include NLP, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), N-grams, and Speaker Diarization (SD) algorithms or language models.

**10. Predictive Maintenance**

This involves building an ML predictive learning model to forecast when a machine is likely to fail, enabling you to schedule maintenance beforehand. It is also possible to use ML.NET Model Builder, which analyzes sensor data to figure out when a machine is broken down.

Aspirants can build a real-time application using Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique to predict house prices. Usually, people use the Naive Bayes algorithm for price prediction.

**5. Generative Adversarial Networks**

The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is an ML framework that involves training two deep learning models to compete against each other and generate high-quality content. It can be used for multiple purposes like translating satellite images to Google map images, medical image synthesis, and removing background noise from videos.

**6. Multimodal Learning**

One can also develop a multimodal ML model that learns simultaneously from multiple data types, such as text, images, and audio. This involves combining multiple deep learning models to extract and fuse information from different modalities. Furthermore, one can use this model for various purposes like image recognition and text-to-image generation.
